# The Hive - Distributed Memory Architecture

## Overview
The Hive's distributed memory system is designed to support 65+ specialized agents working collaboratively on Filipino healthcare applications. This system prioritizes cultural context preservation, seamless coordination, and enterprise-grade reliability.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Memory Topology
- **Hierarchical Distributed Architecture**: Three-tier memory system
- **Edge Nodes**: Agent-specific memory caches (65+ nodes)
- **Regional Clusters**: Domain-specific memory pools (Health, Culture, Tech)
- **Central Coordination Hub**: Master memory orchestrator

### 2. Cultural Context Storage
- **Filipino Cultural Ontology**: Structured storage for Filipino healthcare customs
- **Language Context**: Taglish, Tagalog, regional dialects
- **Healthcare Practices**: Traditional and modern Filipino medicine integration
- **Family Dynamics**: Extended family decision-making patterns

### 3. Memory Sharing Protocols
- **CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)**: For concurrent updates
- **Vector Clocks**: Distributed timestamp management
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Consensus for critical health decisions
- **Cultural Sensitivity Filtering**: Content adaptation based on region/culture

## Memory Categories

### Agent-Specific Memory
- **Personal Context**: Agent role, specialization, learning history
- **Task Memory**: Current assignments, progress, dependencies
- **Performance Metrics**: Efficiency, accuracy, cultural sensitivity scores

### Shared Domain Memory
- **Healthcare Knowledge**: Medical protocols, Philippine health standards
- **Cultural Intelligence**: Filipino customs, beliefs, communication styles
- **Technical Patterns**: Code patterns, architecture decisions, best practices

### Cross-Agent Coordination Memory
- **Project State**: Current sprint status, milestone progress
- **Decision History**: Major architectural and cultural decisions
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolved disputes, consensus mechanisms

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Priority: Critical)
1. Redis Cluster setup with cultural data partitioning
2. Memory conflict resolution mechanisms
3. Agent registration and discovery service

### Phase 2: Cultural Intelligence (Priority: High)
1. Filipino cultural context storage
2. Language-aware memory indexing
3. Cultural sensitivity validation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Priority: Medium)
1. Predictive memory preloading
2. Garbage collection optimization
3. Cross-session persistence

## Performance Targets
- **Response Time**: <50ms for agent memory access
- **Availability**: 99.95% uptime with automatic failover
- **Consistency**: Strong consistency for health data, eventual for non-critical
- **Scalability**: Support 100+ agents with linear performance scaling
