# Development Workflows for Cold Calling Dashboard

## Agent OS Development Process

### Feature Development Workflow

#### 1. Specification Creation
```bash
# Use Agent OS to create detailed specifications
@~/.agent-os/instructions/create-spec.md

# Input template for cold calling features
Feature: [Feature Name]
Domain: [sales-specialist|script-master|lead-intelligence|voip-engineer]
Priority: [high|medium|low]
Phase: [1-9 based on roadmap]
Dependencies: [list of dependent features]

# Example usage
@~/.agent-os/instructions/create-spec.md

Feature: Real-time Lead Scoring
Domain: lead-intelligence
Priority: high
Phase: 2
Dependencies: Database Integration, Lead Data Enrichment
```

#### 2. Implementation Planning
```bash
# Generate implementation plan with Agent OS
@~/.agent-os/instructions/plan-feature.md

# Agent OS will consult relevant specialists:
# - sales-specialist.md for business logic
# - script-master.md for conversation flow
# - lead-intelligence.md for data requirements
# - voip-engineer.md for integration needs
```

#### 3. Code Development
```bash
# Frontend Development (React)
cd frontend/
npm run test:watch  # Keep tests running during development

# Create new component
mkdir src/components/NewFeature
touch src/components/NewFeature/index.js
touch src/components/NewFeature/NewFeature.test.js

# Follow existing patterns from Phase 0 components
# Use inline styles for consistency
# Implement with dummy data first, API integration later
```

#### 4. Testing Strategy
```bash
# Unit Tests (maintain 70%+ coverage)
npm run test:coverage

# Integration Tests
npm run test:integration

# E2E Tests  
npm run test:e2e

# Continuous Testing
npm run test:ci
