## 🧪 Test Types Explained

### 1. Smoke Tests (`smoke.test.js`)
**Purpose**: Verify basic functionality works
- All components render
- No crashes
- Essential UI elements present

### 2. Unit Tests (`components/__tests__/`)
**Purpose**: Test individual components in isolation
- Button clicks work
- State changes correctly
- Props are handled properly
- Edge cases covered

### 3. Integration Tests (`App.integration.test.js`)
**Purpose**: Test components working together
- Multi-component workflows
- Data flow between components
- User interactions across UI

### 4. E2E Tests (`workflows.e2e.test.js`)
**Purpose**: Test complete user journeys
- Full sales call workflow
- Lead management process
- Script preparation
- Error recovery

## 📝 Test Utilities

### Available Helpers (`utils/testUtils.js`)
- `setupUser()` - User event setup
- `generateMockLead()` - Create test data
- `mockConsole()` - Spy on console

## 🏆 Testing Best Practices Applied

✅ **AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert
✅ **User-Centric**: Test behavior, not implementation
✅ **Descriptive Names**: Clear test descriptions
✅ **Fast Execution**: Tests run quickly
✅ **Independent Tests**: No test depends on another
✅ **Mock External Dependencies**: Clipboard, console, etc.
✅ **Coverage Thresholds**: Enforce quality standards
✅ **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing pipeline
