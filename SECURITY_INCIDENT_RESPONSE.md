## üéØ Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

| **Level** | **Description** | **Response Time** | **Escalation** |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **P1 - Critical** | Active attack, data breach, system compromise | 15 minutes | Immediate C-level |
| **P2 - High** | Suspected breach, major vulnerability | 1 hour | Security team + Management |
| **P3 - Medium** | Security policy violation, minor vulnerability | 4 hours | Security team |
| **P4 - Low** | Security audit finding, informational | 24 hours | Security team |

### Incident Types

#### Authentication & Access Control
- **Unauthorized access** to systems or data
- **Privilege escalation** attempts or successes
- **Account takeover** incidents
- **Failed authentication** patterns indicating brute force
- **Suspicious login** patterns (unusual locations, times)

#### Data Security
- **Data exfiltration** or unauthorized data access
- **Data corruption** or unauthorized modification
- **Personal data breaches** (GDPR incidents)
- **Database compromise** or SQL injection attacks

#### Application Security
- **XSS attacks** or code injection attempts
- **API abuse** or unauthorized API access
- **File upload** security violations
- **Rate limiting** bypasses or DDoS attacks

#### Infrastructure Security
- **System compromise** or malware detection
- **Network intrusion** attempts

## üîÑ Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection & Triage (0-15 minutes)

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Document the incident**
   - Timestamp of detection
   - How incident was discovered
   - Initial assessment of scope
   - Screenshot/log evidence

2. **Assess severity** using classification matrix
3. **Activate response team** based on severity
4. **Preserve evidence**
   - Take system snapshots
   - Preserve log files
   - Document system state

#### Detection Sources
- **Automated alerts** from monitoring systems
- **Audit log anomalies** from security scanning
- **User reports** of suspicious activity
- **External notifications** (customers, researchers, vendors)
- **Vulnerability scans** and security assessments

### Phase 2: Containment & Analysis (15 minutes - 2 hours)

#### Containment Strategy
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Identify Threat] --> B{Assess Impact}
    B -->|Low Impact| C[Monitor & Document]
    B -->|Medium Impact| D[Isolate Affected Systems]
    B -->|High Impact| E[Emergency Shutdown]
    E --> F[Activate Backup Systems]
    D --> G[Implement Temporary Controls]
    C --> H[Continue Investigation]
    G --> H
    F --> H
```

#### Technical Analysis
1. **Log Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Check audit logs for suspicious activity
   grep -i "SECURITY_VIOLATION" /var/log/audit/*.log
   
   # Review authentication attempts
   grep -i "LOGIN_FAILED" /var/log/audit/*.log
   
   # Check for privilege escalation
   grep -i "AUTHORIZATION" /var/log/audit/*.log
   ```

2. **System Integrity Verification**
   ```bash
   # Check for unauthorized changes
   npm audit
   
   # Verify application integrity
   node -e "console.log(require('./src/utils/encryption').testEncryption())"
   
   # Database integrity check
   npm run db:check-integrity
   ```

3. **Network Analysis**
   - Review firewall logs
   - Analyze network traffic patterns
   - Check for unusual connections

### Phase 3: Eradication & Recovery (2-8 hours)

#### Eradication Steps
1. **Remove malicious elements**
   - Delete malicious files
   - Close unauthorized access
   - Patch vulnerabilities

2. **Strengthen security controls**
   - Update firewall rules
   - Enhance monitoring
   - Apply additional patches

3. **Verify system integrity**
   - Run security scans
   - Verify backup integrity
   - Test critical functions

#### Recovery Process
1. **Restore from clean backups** if necessary
2. **Apply security updates** and patches
3. **Implement additional monitoring**
4. **Gradually restore services** with enhanced monitoring
5. **Validate functionality** and security controls

### Phase 4: Post-Incident Activities (24-48 hours)

#### Documentation Requirements
1. **Incident Report** including:
   - Timeline of events
   - Root cause analysis
   - Impact assessment
   - Response actions taken
   - Lessons learned

2. **Evidence Preservation**
   - Forensic images
   - Log files
   - Communication records
   - Decision rationale

3. **Stakeholder Communication**
   - Internal debrief
   - Customer notifications
   - Regulatory reporting
   - Public disclosure (if required)
