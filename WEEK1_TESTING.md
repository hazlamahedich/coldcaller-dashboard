## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "npm: command not found"
**Solution:** Node.js isn't installed. Go back to prerequisites and install Node.js.

### Issue: Page is blank
**Solution:** 
1. Check browser console for errors (F12 â†’ Console)
2. Make sure all component files were created
3. Try stopping server (Ctrl+C) and running `npm start` again

### Issue: "Module not found" error
**Solution:**
1. Check that all files are in correct folders
2. File names must match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Make sure imports in App.js are correct

### Issue: Styles look broken
**Solution:**
1. This is normal for Week 1 - we'll add Tailwind CSS in Week 2
2. Components should still be functional even if not pretty

## Success Indicators

You know Week 1 is working when:
âœ… All 4 components appear on screen
âœ… Dial pad accepts input and shows numbers
âœ… Lead navigation works (3 leads)
âœ… Scripts change with color coding
âœ… Audio player shows 3 categories with clips
âœ… Console shows messages when interacting
âœ… No red errors in browser console

## What's Next (Week 2 Preview)

Next week we'll make everything beautiful by:
- Installing Tailwind CSS
- Creating a professional color scheme
- Adding icons and animations
- Making the layout responsive (works on mobile)
- Adding dark mode toggle
